Configured S3 backups
---------------------

This uses the backup_to_s3.py script by @simonw to help configure your 
local backups, so that they can be run by e.g. cron.

Check out the repository and drop backup_to_s3.py into it:

	http://simonwillison.net/2008/Sep/21/backup/

You need example_conf/INIT.conf in ~/.backup_to_s3/INIT.conf to begin.

Then you can copy example_conf/site.conf to any number of configuration 
files in ~/.backup_to_s3 e.g. ~/.backup_to_s3/mywebsite.conf .

You can perform a dry run (no upload to S3) by running:

 * ./backup.py mywebsite
 * ./backup.py ALL [searches for all .conf files and tries them all]

If you're happy with the results, run:

 * ./backup.py mywebsite go
 * ./backup.py ALL go

to actually commit the backup(s) to S3.
