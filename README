Configured S3 backups
---------------------

This uses the backup_to_s3.py script by @simonw to help configure your 
local backups, so that they can be run by e.g. cron. Thanks to @simonw, 
the backup script is now included with this repository (see the credits 
below for more details.)


= Setup =

1. Install the python-boto libraries on your machine.

2. Check out this repository anywhere on your filesystem.

3. Copy example_conf/INIT.conf in ~/.backup_to_s3/INIT.conf and edit the
public and private access keys.

4. Then copy example_conf/site.conf to any number of configuration 
files in ~/.backup_to_s3 e.g. ~/.backup_to_s3/mywebsite.conf .


= Execution =

You can perform a dry run (no upload to S3) by running:

 * ./backup.py mywebsite
 * ./backup.py ALL [searches for all .conf files and tries them all]

If you're happy with the results, run:

 * ./backup.py mywebsite go
 * ./backup.py ALL go

to actually commit the backup(s) to S3.
